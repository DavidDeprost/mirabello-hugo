# Mirabello website
This is a remake of the [Mirabello website](https://www.rcmirabello.be/index.php/nl/) as a static site
to get acquainted with the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

The remake can be found here: https://daviddeprost.github.io/mirabello-hugo/.

Additionally, this remake is also a
[PWA (Progressive Web Application)](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/):  
it makes use of a `serviceworker` for caching, which allows it to be installed on a mobile device for offline use.
